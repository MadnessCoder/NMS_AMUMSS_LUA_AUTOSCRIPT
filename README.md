Limits of applicability.  
 -It works only with EXML files with same structure of properties. For example, if some properties were added in 1.exml and other were deleted in 2.exml this script shouldn't be used.  



============  
Initially, I relied on the naive mjstral script, that tried to do the same.  
But then my script became so big and different that it would be lie to say that it is based on it.  
Though, we always stand on the shoulders of giants. And his script was a good base to push off.
